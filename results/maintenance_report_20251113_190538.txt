Generated on: 2025-11-13 19:05:38

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 1000
Number of Generations: 10
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 41.28
Average Maintenance Cost: 204.15
Average Failure Rate: 11.6630
Total Fitness Improvement: 4.47
Convergence Generation: 10

Cost Trend: decreased by 16.19 (from 213.25 to 197.06)
Failure Trend: decreased by 0.925 (from 12.181 to 11.256)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 4.27 — stable

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.517
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.492
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.472

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance
⚠️ Slow convergence detected. Consider:
- Increasing population size
- Adjusting mutation rate

5. Summary
---------
🟨 ACCEPTABLE: Strategy works but has room for improvement

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 0.925 while costs decreased by 16.19, indicating a stable balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on early-life interventions (avg intensity 0.517); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Convergence behavior is consistent, so further gains likely require parameter sweeps rather than GA tuning.

7. GA Self-Optimization
---------------------
Adaptive Mutation Rate: 0.020 (base 0.02)
Adaptive Crossover Rate: 0.817 (base 0.8)
Rates expand when fitness plateaus and cool once improvements resume, providing self-optimization without manual tuning.
