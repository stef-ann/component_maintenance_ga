Generated on: 2025-11-13 15:11:53

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 10
Number of Generations: 10
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 28.95
Average Maintenance Cost: 93.62
Average Failure Rate: 5.3500
Total Fitness Improvement: 18.35
Convergence Generation: 102

Cost Trend: decreased by 32.32 (from 127.56 to 95.24)
Failure Trend: decreased by 2.000 (from 7.333 to 5.333)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 4.02 — stable

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.495
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.468
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.492

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance

5. Summary
---------
❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Strategy requires significant optimization

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 2.000 while costs decreased by 32.32, indicating a stable balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on early-life interventions (avg intensity 0.495); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Convergence behavior is consistent, so further gains likely require parameter sweeps rather than GA tuning.
