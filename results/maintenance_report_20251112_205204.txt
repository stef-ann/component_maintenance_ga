Generated on: 2025-11-12 20:52:04

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 10
Number of Generations: 10000
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 14.34
Average Maintenance Cost: 192.26
Average Failure Rate: 10.9500
Total Fitness Improvement: -1.66
Convergence Generation: 1689

Cost Trend: increased by 5.61 (from 200.06 to 205.67)
Failure Trend: increased by 0.400 (from 11.300 to 11.700)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 6.17 — moderately volatile

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.490
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.505
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.486

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance
⚠️ Low overall fitness score. Consider:
- Reviewing maintenance strategy fundamentals
- Adjusting cost-reliability trade-off parameters

5. Summary
---------
❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Strategy requires significant optimization

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability increased by 0.400 while costs increased by 5.61, indicating a moderately volatile balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on mid-life interventions (avg intensity 0.505); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Volatility in late generations suggests tuning mutation/population settings for smoother convergence.

7. GA Self-Optimization
---------------------
Adaptive Mutation Rate: 0.040 (base 0.02)
Adaptive Crossover Rate: 0.950 (base 0.8)
Rates expand when fitness plateaus and cool once improvements resume, providing self-optimization without manual tuning.
