Generated on: 2025-11-12 11:33:21

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 100
Number of Generations: 1000
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 40.44
Average Maintenance Cost: 149.03
Average Failure Rate: 8.5230
Total Fitness Improvement: 18.66
Convergence Generation: 138

Cost Trend: decreased by 65.17 (from 215.29 to 150.12)
Failure Trend: decreased by 3.690 (from 12.320 to 8.630)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 4.44 — stable

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.450
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.535
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.526

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance

5. Summary
---------
🟨 ACCEPTABLE: Strategy works but has room for improvement

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 3.690 while costs decreased by 65.17, indicating a stable balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on mid-life interventions (avg intensity 0.535); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Convergence behavior is consistent, so further gains likely require parameter sweeps rather than GA tuning.

7. GA Self-Optimization
---------------------
Adaptive Mutation Rate: 0.040 (base 0.02)
Adaptive Crossover Rate: 0.950 (base 0.8)
Rates expand when fitness plateaus and cool once improvements resume, providing self-optimization without manual tuning.
