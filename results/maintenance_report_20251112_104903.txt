Generated on: 2025-11-12 10:49:03

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 100
Number of Generations: 1000
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 43.36
Average Maintenance Cost: 142.22
Average Failure Rate: 8.1300
Total Fitness Improvement: 26.78
Convergence Generation: 152

Cost Trend: decreased by 75.24 (from 213.79 to 138.55)
Failure Trend: decreased by 4.340 (from 12.260 to 7.920)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 5.05 — moderately volatile

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.431
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.556
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.524

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance

5. Summary
---------
🟨 ACCEPTABLE: Strategy works but has room for improvement

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 4.340 while costs decreased by 75.24, indicating a moderately volatile balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on mid-life interventions (avg intensity 0.556); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Volatility in late generations suggests tuning mutation/population settings for smoother convergence.

7. GA Self-Optimization
---------------------
Adaptive Mutation Rate: 0.040 (base 0.02)
Adaptive Crossover Rate: 0.950 (base 0.8)
Rates expand when fitness plateaus and cool once improvements resume, providing self-optimization without manual tuning.
