Generated on: 2025-11-12 20:47:04

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 10000
Number of Generations: 10
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 45.15
Average Maintenance Cost: 203.81
Average Failure Rate: 11.6463
Total Fitness Improvement: 1.87
Convergence Generation: 10

Cost Trend: decreased by 18.91 (from 213.51 to 194.60)
Failure Trend: decreased by 1.080 (from 12.201 to 11.120)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 2.82 — stable

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.477
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.457
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.467

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance
⚠️ Slow convergence detected. Consider:
- Increasing population size
- Adjusting mutation rate

5. Summary
---------
🟨 ACCEPTABLE: Strategy works but has room for improvement

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 1.080 while costs decreased by 18.91, indicating a stable balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on early-life interventions (avg intensity 0.477); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Convergence behavior is consistent, so further gains likely require parameter sweeps rather than GA tuning.

7. GA Self-Optimization
---------------------
Adaptive Mutation Rate: 0.023 (base 0.02)
Adaptive Crossover Rate: 0.845 (base 0.8)
Rates expand when fitness plateaus and cool once improvements resume, providing self-optimization without manual tuning.
