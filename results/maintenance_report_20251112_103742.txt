Generated on: 2025-11-12 10:37:42

1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 100
Number of Generations: 1000
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 25.69
Average Maintenance Cost: 149.72
Average Failure Rate: 8.5505
Total Fitness Improvement: 58.23
Convergence Generation: 105

Cost Trend: decreased by 64.13 (from 216.27 to 152.13)
Failure Trend: decreased by 3.730 (from 12.410 to 8.680)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 14.78 — highly volatile

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.514
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.505
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.502

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance

5. Summary
---------
❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Strategy requires significant optimization

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 3.730 while costs decreased by 64.13, indicating a highly volatile balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on early-life interventions (avg intensity 0.514); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Volatility in late generations suggests tuning mutation/population settings for smoother convergence.
