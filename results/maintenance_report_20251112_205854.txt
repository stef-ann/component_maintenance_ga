1. Configuration Parameters
--------------------------
β (Beta): 2.50 - Wear-out failure mode
η (Eta): 50 - Characteristic life parameter
Population Size: 10
Number of Generations: 10000
Mutation Rate: 0.02
Lambda Factor: 0.7 (reliability weight vs. cost penalties)

2. Performance Metrics
--------------------
Final Fitness Score: 19.75
Average Maintenance Cost: 121.17
Average Failure Rate: 6.9500
Total Fitness Improvement: 4.93
Convergence Generation: 132

Cost Trend: decreased by 8.60 (from 123.12 to 114.52)
Failure Trend: decreased by 0.333 (from 7.000 to 6.667)
Fitness Stability (σ last 20 gens): 4.28 — stable

3. Maintenance Strategy Analysis
------------------------------
Early-life Maintenance Level (0-20%): 0.535
Mid-life Maintenance Level (20-70%): 0.524
Late-life Maintenance Level (70-100%): 0.531

4. Recommendations
-----------------
⚠️ High failure rate detected. Consider:
- Increasing maintenance intensity in high-risk periods
- Reducing intervals between maintenance actions
⚠️ High maintenance costs detected. Consider:
- Optimizing maintenance scheduling
- Reviewing cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance
⚠️ Low overall fitness score. Consider:
- Reviewing maintenance strategy fundamentals
- Adjusting cost-reliability trade-off parameters

5. Summary
---------
❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Strategy requires significant optimization

6. Conclusion
------------
Reliability decreased by 0.333 while costs decreased by 8.60, indicating a stable balance between risk and spend.
The strategy leans on early-life interventions (avg intensity 0.535); consider redistributing effort if other life stages show lagging health.
Convergence behavior is consistent, so further gains likely require parameter sweeps rather than GA tuning.
